To run this set up you will need to first need to set up the certificates, which you can find instructions for in the how_ssl.md file

For this example there is a train, validation and test set, which should each be a folder in your directory somewhere. In each folder, there will two subfolders for each class of laterality where R is 1 and L is 0

Paths for train/val/will need to be updated appropriately and if you don't see a stable performance e.g, not getting consistent accuracy close to 1.0, try lowering the learning rate (e.g., changing 0.0005 to 0.0002)


Once set up (with IP addresses set appropriately)

run python3 server.py to start the server

and python3 client.py to start the servers

Be sure to configure the minimum number of clients, min_fit_clients, in the server.py
