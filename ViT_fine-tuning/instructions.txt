To run this set up you will need to first need to set up the certificates, which you can find instructions for in the how_ssl.md file

For this example there is only a training set, which should be in a folder accessed via ../data/files',

In the /data/ folder, there should also be a data.csv where there in a colum called 'laterality_binary' which should be a binary value for each image. R is 1 and L is 0


Once set up (with IP addresses set appropriately)

run python3 server.py to start the server

and python3 client.py to start the servers

Be sure to configure the minimum number of clients, min_fit_clients, in the server.py


This approach uses the old version of the Flower API
